In this tutorial, we will explore how to deploy a website on AWS EC2, using Docker to containerize the application, and configuring NGINX as a reverse proxy. EC2, a service provided by Amazon Web Services, allows us to launch and manage virtual servers in the cloud, offering a powerful and flexible environment for deploying applications. Docker will help us package the application into a container, ensuring consistency and ease of deployment across different environments. Finally, we will use NGINX to handle HTTP requests, optimizing performance and enhancing security for the application.
