You will learn how to create an EC2 instance, install Docker, and build a container to run your web application. Following that, we will configure NGINX as a reverse proxy to efficiently route HTTP requests to your container. This guide will not only help you understand each step of the deployment process but also assist in optimizing and securing your application on the cloud.\nContent Introduction Preparation Connect to EC2 instance Manage session logs Port Forwarding Clean up resources "

EC2, a service provided by Amazon Web Services, allows us to launch and manage virtual servers in the cloud, offering a powerful and flexible environment for deploying applications. Docker will help us package the application into a container, ensuring consistency and ease of deployment across different environments. Finally, we will use NGINX to handle HTTP requests, optimizing performance and enhancing security for the application.\n"
